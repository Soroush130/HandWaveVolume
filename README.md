# HandWaveVolume

HandWaveVolume is an innovative project that allows users to control their computer's volume using hand gestures, detected through computer vision techniques. By leveraging the power of **MediaPipe** and **OpenCV**, this project recognizes specific hand landmarks and translates them into system volume control actions.

## Features

- **Gesture Recognition**: Recognizes thumb and index finger movements to control volume.
- **Real-Time Control**: Adjust the system's audio in real-time using natural hand movements.
- **Hands-Free Interface**: No need to interact with any physical volume controls; simply use your hand!

## How It Works

1. **Hand Detection**: Using **MediaPipe Hands**, the software detects the user's hand landmarks.
2. **Gesture Mapping**: Predefined gestures (such as moving your hand up or down) are mapped to volume control actions.
3. **Volume Control**: Using **pycaw**, the system adjusts the volume based on detected hand gestures.

## Requirements

To get started, you will need the following libraries:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe pycaw comtypes
```
